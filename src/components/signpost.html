                        <h2>Required elements</h2>
                        <h3>Link</h3>
                        <p>Link text should:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>be between one and 4 words in length</li>
                            <li>be actionable</li>
                            <li>make it clear where the link will take the user</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Keeping the line length short helps people to find what they want and stops the size of the card/button becoming too big.</p>
                        <h3>Text</h3>
                        <p>Use a brief line of text, preferably a single sentence, to provide more information.</p>
                        <p>This could be the length of time the service will be affected or a link.</p>

                        <p>The image must relate to the content.</p>
                        <p>It must have an alt tag that describes the image content. For more information, <a href="https://www.coop.co.uk/accessibility/standards#text-alternatives">go to the accessibility standard for alternative text.</p></a>
                        <p>If you are creating a signpost in our content management system Contentful, you should upload a 780px (width) × 438 (height) image. Contentful will then generate and add the required image sizes.</p>
                        <p>If you are creating a signpost using the code rather than in the CMS, you should supply 2 image sizes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>780px (width) × 438px (height)</li>
                            <li>400px (width) × 225px (height)</li> 
                        </ul> 
                        <p>The component contains code that will serve the correct image size depending on the capability of the browser and size of the device.</p>

                        <h2>Using signpost navigation on a page</h2>
                        <p>You can build a simple list of links or sub navigation by grouping signposts together. This can be useful if you need to provide several links on a particular theme.</p>
                        <p>Group signposts in horizontal columns of 2 to 4 using the grid. The grid helps to adapt the number of columns displayed over different screen sizes.</p>
                        <p>Do not use more than 2 rows of signposts in a group.</p>
