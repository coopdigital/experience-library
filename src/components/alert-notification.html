                        <h2>Guidelines</h2>
                        <p>Use alert notifications to highlight events that might limit availability of a service we provide. For example if:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the service the user is trying to access is experiencing problems</li>
                            <li>planned system maintenance is coming soon</li>
                            <li>the userâ€™s login session is about to expire</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Only use alert notifications when absolutely necessary. Using them too often could make the problem worse. </p>
                        <p>We know that people often miss or ignore banners. <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/banner-blindness-old-and-new-findings/">Go to Nielsen Norman Group research on banners.</p></a>

                        <h2>Required elements</h2>
                        <h3>Title</h3>
                        <p>The alert title should clearly state the problem or potential problem.</p>
                        <h3>Text</h3>
                        <p>Use a brief line of text, preferably a single sentence, to provide more information.</p>
                        <p>This could be the length of time the service will be affected or a link.</p>

                        <h2>Optional elements</h2>
                        <h3>Link</h3>
                        <p>If a link is used it should direct the user to more information or an action they can take to solve the problem.</p>
                        <p>You can also make the whole notification into a clickable link.</p>
                        <p>Make sure that any text link you include and this link go to the same place.</p>
