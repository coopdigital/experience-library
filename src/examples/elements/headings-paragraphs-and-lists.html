            <h1>Packaging and recycling</h1>
            <p class="coop-t-lead-p">Packaging has a place, it protects our food and keeps it fresher and safe for longer. We want to keep plastics and packaging in the economy and out of the oceans by using less and making our products easy to recycle. Find out what we’re doing to make a difference.</p>
            <h2>Our story so far</h2>
            <p>We've always been at the forefront of removing hidden plastic and unnecessary packaging, from removing plastic from cotton buds 11 years, banning microbeads and changing our own-brand straws to paper not plastic. In 2017 we stated that we want to make all our packaging easy to recycle. We’ve moved from 46% of our products being easy to recycle to 74%. The result is that almost three-quarters of our own brand products are being widely recycled, 95% of the packaging for all these products when measured by weight.</p>
            <p>The meeting agenda will be:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>an overview of the last month</li>
                <li>a presentation</li>
                <li>a special announcement</li>
            </ul>
