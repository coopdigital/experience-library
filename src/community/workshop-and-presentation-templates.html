            <h2>Templates for workshops and activities</h2>
            <p>
              We've collected a set of templates in Miro (our online
              collaboration tool) to allow us to run consistent and efficient
              workshops.
            </p>
            <h3>Assumption mapping</h3>
            <p>
              It's important to be aware of the assumptions you're making about
              the product or service your team is making.
            </p>
            <p>This activity helps a group discuss and make clear:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>what assumptions have we made in this product?</li>
              <li>how impactful are they to the success of the product?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOE_4w58=/"
                >Go to the assumption mapping template</a
              >
            </p>
            <h3>Avatar check-in</h3>
            <p>
              Use avatars to check in to workshops and meetings can help teams
              connect.
            </p>
            <p>
              They give remote colleagues a digital presence and can be used to
              signal when someone does and does not want to input in to any
              activities.
            </p>

            <h3>Consequence scanning</h3>
            <p>
              Use consequence scanning to help your team to ensure the products
              and services you create are aligned with Co-op's values and
              culture.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this workshop you'll identify the possible intended and
              unintended consequences of your product or service.
            </p>
