                    <h2>Guidelines</h2>
                    <p>Borders should be between 1 and 4px wide.</p>
                    <p>Use dark grey (#6E6E6E) if:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the border is there to help a user find what they need</li>
                        <li>the component it surrounds is clickable</li> 
                    </ul>
                    <p>Use medium grey (#C4C4C4) in all other cases.</p>
                    <p>Use a solid line for borders as these are easy for people to scan along.</p>
                    <p>The colour contrast of the dark grey passes the minimum requirements for graphical objects.</p>
                    <p>Do not overuse borders. If you use lots of borders on a page, it can start to look crowded and may be harder for people to navigate.</p> 
                    <p>Try using headings and spacing to break up pages instead.</p>
