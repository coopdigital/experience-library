info-card-title: Design tokens
info-card-p: 
  - In engineering, foundations are sometimes called design tokens.
  - Design tokens are our foundations represented as data.
  - Design tokens let us maintain and update data around the foundations in one place.
  - We have not created our design tokens yet. When we have, we will add Storybook links to each of the pages in this section.
