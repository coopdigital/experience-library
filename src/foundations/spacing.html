                                <p>As well as our default spacing units, we also have CSS classes that allow you to experiment with variations of spacing.</p>
                                <p>You can multiply the 2px, 4px, 8px, 16px, 32px or 64px by either 1.5 or 2. </p>
                                <p>For example, if your layout requires a large vertical space, you can multiply the 64px unit by 2. This will give you a vertical spacing of 128px.</p>
                                <p>The CSS classes that support this already exist. If youâ€™re unsure, ask the engineers on your team to talk you through them.</p>
                                <p>Horizontal spacing is managed by the gutters that appear between columns in our grid. Above a width of 1300px (for devices like laptops and desktops) these are 32px and below (for devices like tablet and mobile) they are 16px.</p>
                                <p>For more on horizontal spacing go to the grid page</p>
