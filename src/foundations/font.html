intro-text-lead: 
  - We use 2 fonts across all our products. Co-op Headline and Avenir Next. Co-op Headline is our custom typeface, evoking bold and single minded behaviour. 
  - We pair it with Avenir Next, a friendly and functional typeface. We have rules on their usage so that everything looks consistent and we maintain legibility.

                    <h2>Guidelines for Avenir Next</h2>
                    <p>We use the Avenir Next font in regular, medium and demi bold weights.</p>
                    <p>Use:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>regular for large bodies of text</li>
                        <li>medium for buttons and form labels</li>
                        <li>demi bold for headings after the page heading</li> 
                    </ul>
                    <p>The visual contrast between regular and medium or demi bold should make it easy for people to scan content for the information they want. This is why you should never use medium or demi bold for large bodies of text.</p>
                    <p>Avenir Next has clear, open letterforms and letter spacing.</p>
                    <p>This is what the regular, medium and demi bold font weights look like:</p>
                    <p class='font-example-regular'>Avenir Next Regular</p>
                    <p class='font-example-medium'>Avenir Next Medium</p>
