                        <h3 id="acceptance-criteria">Acceptance criteria</h3>
                        <p>Acceptance criteria are a short list of conditions that a task or <a href="#user-stories">user story</a> must meet before it is complete. Each task or user story will have its own list of acceptance criteria, created and agreed by the team before the work gets done.</p>
                        <p>For example, when working on an online shopping site, one user story might be: “as a shopper, I want to choose a delivery slot, so that I know the delivery will arrive when I’m at home to receive it.”</p>
                        <p>Acceptance criteria for this might be that:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the page displays a list of available slots</li>
                            <li>the user can select one slot from the list</li>
                            <li>when the user books a slot, a confirmation message appears</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Acceptance criteria help create a shared understanding of what the user story will cover and what completing the user story means.</p>
                        <p>Acceptance criteria are specific to individual tasks or user stories. A <a href="#definition-of-done">definition of done</a> lists the standards we need to meet for every task or user story.</p>

                        <h3 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>Building products and services that anyone can use, including people:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>who are disabled or have a condition</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>This means designing products and services that everyone can use. Co-op has an <a href="https://www.coop.co.uk/accessibility" target="_blank">accessibility policy</a> and <a href="https://static.coop.co.uk/experience-library/accessibility/" target="_blank">accessibility guidelines</a>.</p>
                        <p>Everyone at Co-op is responsible for making products and services accessible.</p>

                        <h3 id="agile">Agile</h3>
                        <p>Agile is a way of working which helps teams to achieve <a href="#outcome">outcomes</a> and focus on the user.</p>
                        <p>It is an approach to project management that helps teams to deliver value to customers faster and with fewer headaches.</p>
                        <p>An agile team delivers work in small increments. Agile is different to a <a href="#waterfall">waterfall</a> way of working which sets out the detail of a project before it begins and delivers everything together in a big launch.</p>
                        <p>Agile focuses on collaboration and team members are empowered to <a href="#governance">govern</a> and reflect on their progress as a <a href="#teams">team.</a></p>
                        <p>The idea is to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>break down work into smaller tasks with clear goals</li>
                            <li>work together as a team</li>
                            <li>test simple versions of ideas with users</li>
                            <li>use <a href="#feedback">feedback</a> loops  to develop the product or service</li>
                            <li>adapt and change direction when you need to</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Agile is not only about having <a href="#stand-up">stand-ups</a> and using post-its or Trello. It’s important to have the right <a href="#roles-and-responsibilities">team roles</a> and a <a href="#collaborative-working">collaborative working</a> culture place.</p>
                        <p>The most valuable part of working in an agile way is working to <a href="#agile-principles">agile principles</a> and the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html" target="_blank">agile manifesto</a>. The 4 values of agile:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</li>
                            <li>Working products or services over excess documentation</li>
                            <li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li>
                            <li>Responding to change over following a plan</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Agile activities</h3>
                        <p>Tools, methods or activities which help teams to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>create shared understanding</li>
                            <li>use <a href="#insight">insights</a> from users to inform decisions about what to focus on next</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Co-op's <a href="https://static.coop.co.uk/experience-library/ways-of-working/activities/">activities for <a href="#agile">agile</a> stages</a> include guidance on how to prepare and step-by-step instructions on how to do the activity.  You can adapt these activities for the problems that you are working on in your team.</p>
                        <p>We do not have activities for everything but we’re working on it. You can also use our resource list.</p>
                        <h3 id="agile-principles">Agile principles</h3>
                        <p><a href="#agile">Agile</a> ways of working are rooted in <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">12 principles</a>:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Deliver value to users early</li>
                            <li>Embrace change</li>
                            <li>Deliver frequently</li>
                            <li>Work in cross-functional teams</li>
                            <li>Support and trust your people</li>
                            <li>Communicate face-to-face</li>
                            <li>Measure progress by what you deliver</li>
                            <li>Maintain a sustainable pace</li>
                            <li>Keep a focus on quality and excellence</li>
                            <li>Keep it simple</li>
                            <li>Self-organise for best results</li>
                            <li>Inspect and adapt</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>There are different ways of doing <a href="#agile">agile</a> like <a href="#scrum">Scrum</a>, <a href="#sprint">Sprints</a>, <a href="#kanban">Kanban</a> and Test-Driven Development (TDD). Ways of working are only <a href="#agile">agile</a> if your team is doing all the things in the 12 principles.</p>

                        <p>Making sure that everyone has a shared understanding of what the team is doing or trying to achieve.</p>
                        <p>Teams do this through communication methods called <a href="#ceremonies">ceremonies</a>.

                        <h3 id="alpha">Alpha</h3>
                        <p>There are four main stages to agile product development: discovery, alpha, beta and live. This is one way of organising and releasing new product developments.</p>
                        <p>Alpha comes after the <a href="#discovery">Discovery</a> stage and before the <a href="#beta">Beta</a> stage.</p>
                        <p>In an alpha you should:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>understand what users need</li>
                            <li>work collaboratively</li>
                            <li>create early proofs of concept</li>
                            <li>research it with users</li>
                            <li>learn from it</li>
                            <li>decide if it’s worth developing further</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The product or service may only have minimal features at this point. The idea is to test whether the concept works for the user before spending time and money developing it.</p>
                        <p>To move your product or service from <a href="#discovery">discovery</a> to alpha stage you typically have:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a team assigned to the work</li>
                            <li>budget approved by leaders</li>
                            <li>a space for your team to work and support from the business</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Assumption</h3>
                        <p>Something you assume to be true about your users or product. Often you test this in research.</p>

                        <h3>Assumption mapping</h3>
                        <p>An activity to work out what you do and do not know about your users.</p>
                        <p>You can use your team’s <a href="#hypothesis">hypothesis</a> to write down assumptions and map them on a 4-way matrix of:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>known to unknown</li>
                            <li>important to not imporatant</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This helps you to decide what to focus on next  when you do research.</p>

                        <h3 id="beta">Beta</h3>
                        <p>To move from an <a href="#alpha">alpha</a> to a beta phase, you must have:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a Co-op business area committed to sponsor all, or part of, the service</li>
                            <li>budget approved by leaders</li>
                            <li>measures of success agreed between you and the business</li>
                            <li>regular funding and performance reviews set up</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>In a Beta you should:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>learn how to build and run your product or service</li>
                            <li>make it scalable</li>
                            <li>get users to try it</li>
                            <li>test real data securely</li>
                            <li>learn from users</li>
                            <li>integrate it with the existing service</li>
                            <li>meet Co-op service quality guidelines</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Beta is the stage of a project when you build on a minimal product or service.</p>
                        <p>Beta comes after <a href="#alpha">Alpha</a> and before the <a href="#live">Live</a> stage. </p>

                        <p>Day-to-day content designers do things like create content for websites, forms, apps or presentations, check the <a href="#accessibility">accessibility</a> of content and create a content strategy for a product or service.</p>
                        <p>Content designers are not usually responsible for interactive design or graphic design in the team.</p>

                        <h3>Continuous improvement</h3>
                        <p>Continuous improvement can mean different things. At Co-op it’s always about making things better. It could be continuing to test and improve a product or service after it goes <a href="#live">live</a>.  It could be continuing to improve the way the team works together.</p>
                        <p>The important thing is that team makes decisions on what to improve together after considering all of evidence. It’s not based on one person’s opinion or request.</p>

                        <h3>Converge</h3>
                        <p>Divergent and convergent thinking are two different stages of problem solving.</p>
                        <p>Creating lots of ideas (diverging) at the same time as judging which ones are good (converging) can be confusing.</p>
                        <p>People tend to get better outcomes by doing divergent and convergent tasks separately.</p>
                        <p>Examples of using divergent and convergent tasks together include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>diverging by asking everyone to write lots of possible next steps for a project, then converging by using <a href="#priority-mapping">priority mapping</a> to agree which to work on first</li>
                            <li>diverging using <a href="#rapid-eights">rapid eights</a> to generate lots of ideas, then converging using <a href="#dot-voting">dot voting</a> to agree which of those to develop further</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 id="crits">Crits</h3>
                        <p>Team members share ideas early in the process so that they can use the group’s <a href="#feedback">feedback</a> to improve it before showing it to users. The person that created the work usually leads the crit.</p>
                        <p>A crit is not sharing a document for people to comment individually or pass onto someone else for the next version. The value of crits is that everyone responds to the design or content together, learns from comments and agrees what the next version should be in real time.</p>
                        <p>Sharing early versions of design and content saves time and money because: </p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>you don’t spend time finessing content or design which was never going to work</li>
                        <li>you make decisions on the content together in one meeting, not by waiting for several people to have time look at one after the other</li>
                        <li>you share learning and avoid repeating mistakes across different teams</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Cross-team working can help people to learn skills from each other. It can also help teams to bring different perspectives to help solve a problem.</p>
                        <p>For example, a team member from the e-commerce team could work with a team member from Membership. They could share what they have learned about accessibility from user research on their products.</p>

                        <p>Definition of done is a list of conditions that any task or user story must meet before it is considered complete.</p>
                        <p>The team will agree this list. Some examples could be:</p>

                        <p>There are lots of different kinds of design. At Co-op you might hear people talk about:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>architecture design</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Design thinking provides a solution-based approach to problems. It’s a way of thinking and working as well as a collection of hands-on methods.</p>
                        <p>Teams aim to understand the user, challenge assumptions, and define problems. By working in this way teams can find solutions quickly and can change direction if they need to.</p>

                        <p>In a discovery you should:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>find out who your users are</li>

                        <li>learn from users and the business</li>
                        <li>see if and where there are opportunities to help users and the business</li>

                        <h3>How might we</h3>
                        <p>A statement that helps teams think about problems to produce ideas for possible solutions.</p>
                        <p>The team creates and prioritises the statements together to understand:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>which ideas to focus on next</li>
                            <li>why they are working on them</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>How might we sessions are good preparation for a sketching session.</p>

                        <h3 id="hypothesis">Hypothesis</h3>
                        <p>A statement that helps teams address problems.</p>
                        <p>The format is:</p>
                        <p><strong>We believe that</strong>... (assumption of the user’s behaviour)</p>
                        <p><strong>So if we</strong>... (action in terms of how we can help the user)</p>
                        <p><strong>Then we will see</strong> (a result or measure of success)</p>
                        <p>Using hypotheses helps teams to think about the impact of solutions and risks before they take any action.</p>
                        <p>For example, when working on an online shopping site:</p>
                        <p><strong>We believe that</strong>... we’re causing confusion by showing members up to 10 offers at once</p>
                        <p><strong>So if we</strong>... reduce the number of options to 3 at any one time</p>
                        <p><strong>Then we will see</strong>... an increase in offer selections and sales</p>
                        <p>This example gives the team a problem area to explore: “how might we make the offers more prominent?” It also gives the team a way to evaluate the hypothesis. If they try several changes to make the offers more prominent but sales don’t change, it’s likely this hypothesis is incorrect.</p>

                        <p>Kanban is a method for:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>visualising a workflow</li>
                            <li>managing the flow of work</li>
                            <li>making changes to the process to improve it</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The method came from manufacturing originally (the Toyota Production System) and is now used for lots of types of work.</p>
                        <p>A few key practices in kanban are to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>make your current process visible (often using a kanban board)</li>
                            <li>limit the amount of work in progress (WIP)</li>
                            <li>focus on improving problem areas that slow down the flow of work</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Kanban starts with your current process, letting you understand what’s working and gradually change things over time.</p>

                        <p>A way to visualise the work that a team is doing based on the kanban technique. It can be a physical or virtual kanban board.</p>
                        <p>A simple kanban board has three columns: ‘to do’, ‘doing’ and ‘done’, but there are different versions.</p>
                        <p>The team decide: what columns to have, which checklists to include such as definition of done, other policies about the process of their work.</p>
                        <p>You can reflect on the content of the kanban board and change this over time.</p>
                        <p>The team uses the kanban board in daily stand-ups to track progress during the working week. When people are working remotely they often use a Trello board for this.</p>

                        <p>Outcomes are the results of what you do as a team. It is not the same as outputs which are the things you produce as a team.</p>
                        <p>For example:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Output:</strong> A website with 5 different ways to ask for help</li>
                            <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> A website which helps the user to find help when they need it </li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Output:</strong> A report which says that you have completed all 30 tasks which your annual plan set out</li>
                            <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> A summary of user research which shows that all of your users can use your product or service</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Your team needs to agree how they are going to know that they achieve their outcomes.</p>
                        <p>You can do this with combination of:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>user research</li>
                            <li>testing the product or service</li>
                            <li>metrics, data or other system statistics</li>

                        <p>A visual way to prioritise work using a chart which splits the space into quarters.  Your team place each piece of work on a quarter split by:</p>

                        <p>Quantitative methods usually involve large numbers of participants and focus on the ‘what’ users are doing. Quantitative data is recorded in a structured format, for example, asking people for yes or no answers and asking them to answer on a scale of 1-10.</p>
                        <p>It’s sometimes seen as more scientific and objective than <a href="#qualitative">qualitative research</a> methods. This is not always the case because data can be interpreted in different ways.</p>
                        <p>Methods to collect quantitative data include:</p>
                        <ul>

                        <p>Qualitative data is recorded in a free format so people can answer how they like. Note takers in qualitative research sessions try and write down as close to what people say as possible.</p>
                        <p>The process of collecting qualitative data is sometimes unstructured. It can be time-consuming but leads to in-depth findings.</p>
                        <p>Methods to collect qualitative research data include:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>1-2-1 or group interviews</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>It is important that qualitative research leads to team <a href="#research-synthesis">research synthesis</a> sessions so everyone understands the research findings.</p>

                        <h3>Quality Assurance</h3>
                        <p>Quality assurance is built into the way that <a href="#agile">agile</a> teams research the product with the user.</p>
                        <p>The product or service must:</p>

                        <p>It is based on <a href="#design-thinking">design thinking</a> which teams use to:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>understand the end-to-end user journey</li>

                        <p>A service designer helps the team to:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>visualise the end-to-end journey of a product or service</li>
                        <li>create a shared understanding of the way a user uses a service to complete a goal</li>
                        <li>deliver a business service that benefits the user</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Days-to-day a service designer might carry out user research, produce <a href="#service-map">service maps</a>, lead sessions around understanding the user and design <a href="#prototype">prototypes</a> to test.</p>
                        <p>Service designers do not work alone to understand a process or service. The team, <a href="#sme">SMEs</a> and <a href="#stakeholders">stakeholders</a> all need to contribute to understanding the user journey.</p>
                        <p>As a team member, service designers work closely with the team, going to <a href="#stand-up">stand-ups</a>, planning and retro meetings. They might also help the user researcher or do user research.</p>

                        <h3 id="service-map">Service maps</h3>
                        <p>Service maps show a user journey for your product or service step-by-step. Teams work out all the user’s connections with the service, including the parts that a user can and cannot see.</p>
                        <p>Teams can use service maps to help visualise an existing service and help to identify improvements.  They can also use them to map out how the service could be better in future once they have user research.</p>
                        <p>Also known as service blueprints.</p>

                        <h3 id="show-and-tell">Show and tell</h3>
                        <p>An opportunity to share your team’s progress with a wider audience. Show and tells usually have a regular slot each week, fortnight or month.</p>
                        <p>Show and tell content includes the things you've been working like live demos of the product, working <a href="#prototype">prototypes</a> or research findings. It’s also an opportunity to show what didn’t work so you can share the learning with other teams.</p>

                        <h3>Showcase</h3>
                        <p>A demonstration of what the team has been working on to key <a href="#stakeholders">stakeholders</a>.</p>

                        <p>SME usually means a Subject Matter Expert who is part of the project as a <a href="#stakeholders">stakeholders</a>.</p>
                        <p>The SME has direct experience of a product or service area. For example, if you are creating a product to explain how to carry out health and safety checks, a Co-op colleague from the Health and Safety team would be an SME.</p>
                        <p>SME do not design the product or service, but they might come to some project or <a href="#service-map">service mapping</a> sessions. They can give you <a href="#insight">insights</a> which you can use with user research to build your product.</p>
                        <p>SME also means Small to Medium Enterprise which describes a business with between 30 to 250 employees.</p>

                        <h3 id="sprint">Sprint</h3>

                        <h3 id="stand-up">Stand up</h3>
                        <p>Short team meetings that last between 5 to 15 minutes at the start of the day. They should happen at a time that suits the team.</p>
                        <p>Everyone in the team has an opportunity to say what they’re working on, share problems and ask for help. Often sometimes use a kanban board to make sure they are focusing work on priorities and goals.</p>

                        <h3>Value chain</h3>
                        <p>A business generates income by meeting user needs. Another way to say this: by delivering value to users, they give us money.</p>
                        <p>A value chain is all the activities we do in order to meet those needs. Businesses have lots of value chains for the products and services they provide.</p>
                        <p>An example: if we meet a user’s need to have lunch, the chain might be:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>We buy sandwiches from a supplier, which delivers them to our warehouse.</li>
                            <li>Our trucks drive these to a Co-op store.</li>
                            <li>Our store colleagues move the sandwiches out onto the shelves.</li>
                            <li>A customer (the user) chooses a sandwich and takes it to a till.</li>
                            <li>Our store colleague takes their money.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>By understanding the value chain, we can look at doing steps differently in order to achieve the more value with less cost.</p>
