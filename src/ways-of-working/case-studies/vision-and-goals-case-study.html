                        <h3>What is the Represent network?</h3>
                        <p>Represent began when Carly sent a message on Yammer to connect with other disabled colleagues.</p>
                        <p>In spring 2019 it was 5 colleagues coming together to talk as friends.</p>
                        <blockquote class="coop-u-margin-t-48 coop-u-margin-b-48">
                            <p>We quickly realised that despite having a range of different impairments, our challenges and experiences of disability were similar.</p>
                            <cite>Natalie, Co-op Represent network.</cite>
                        </blockquote>
                        <h3>Why did Represent need a vision?</h3>
                        <p>Natalie describes the responsibility that the group all experienced in the beginning;</p>
                        <blockquote class="coop-u-margin-t-48 coop-u-margin-b-48">
                            <p>The pressure we felt to support colleagues was immense. We were passionate about wanting to change things, but we were trying to get through a mire of complexity. We couldn’t get agreement between ourselves as to what we wanted to achieve.</p>
                            <cite>Natalie, Co-op Represent network.</cite>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>There were two overall challenges: there was a huge demand for support and the group did not feel aligned. There was so much that they could do, but they were struggling to decide what they should do.</p>
                        <blockquote class="coop-u-margin-t-48 coop-u-margin-b-48">
                            <p>We had a group with strong personalities and opinions. As a leader I wanted to bring people together on a journey. I wanted us to be clear about who we are as a group and what we stand for. The vision session was a valuable leadership tool to do that.</p>
                            <cite>Carly, Co-op Represent network chair.</cite>
                        </blockquote>
                        <h3>How did the vision session work?</h3>
                        <p>Carly and the group spent a couple of sessions working on their vision and goals. It was set up in a Miro board so that everyone could work together in a collaborative way.</p>
                        <p>Having it all on screen brought all the work into one space and gave the group another dimension to work in.</p>
                        <blockquote class="coop-u-margin-t-48 coop-u-margin-b-48">
                            <p>Working in this way meant that the session was accessible for all of the group. Having a visual interactive tool and a facilitator was key to making it work for different kinds of learners. If you have a sight impairment or a neurodiverse condition, or deafness, it is easy to miss captions and things being said in Teams meetings.</p>
                            <cite>Natalie, Co-op Represent network.</cite>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>The group worked through the Miro board sections in a step-by-step methodical way. The facilitator helped to keep the group on track and make sure everyone is included.</p>
                        <blockquote class="coop-u-margin-t-48 coop-u-margin-b-48">
                            <p>You can’t underestimate how important structure is to a session like this. Breaking it down so you have 5 mins to do this and 5 mins to do the next thing makes it easier and less complicated. It’s not always possible, but having a facilitator from outside the group can bring a new perspective and help the session progress too.</p>

                        </blockquote>
                        <h3>What did the group discover?</h3>
                        <p>During the vision session the group realised that they needed a ‘people first’ approach and that building a community at Co-op was what was important. They discovered that they were here to ‘represent colleagues’ and so they got their name from the session. The group also decided that they needed to be visible in areas of society where they are excluded.</p>
                        <blockquote class="coop-u-margin-t-48 coop-u-margin-b-48">
                            <p>We wanted everyone to feel empowered to create a vision for ourselves. In a collaborative session everyone owns it. It gives people a platform to question what we’re doing, talk it through and find agreement. It was a huge success and turning point for us.</p>

                        </blockquote>
                        <h3>What impact did the session have?</h3>
                        <blockquote class="coop-u-margin-t-48 coop-u-margin-b-48">
                            <p>Having the vision and mission helped us to talk confidently about what we’re here to do. Without that session we would not have been as succinct and definite about what we wanted to achieve.</p>
                            <cite>Natalie, Co-op Represent network.</cite>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Represent decided that they wanted to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="coop-u-margin-b-8">build a network of people to support each other</li>
                            <li class="coop-u-margin-b-8">educate and raise awareness of disability - including helping people understand what disability means</li>
                            <li class="coop-u-margin-b-8">influence policies and processes within Co-op to remove barriers to success</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Natalie shares some of the misconceptions about disability:</p>
                        <blockquote class="coop-u-margin-t-48 coop-u-margin-b-48">
                            <p>Only 6 or 7% of disabled people are a wheelchair user, but that’s the perception of a disabled person, so it’s not an accurate perception. Disability doesn’t discriminate. We need people to be mindful that it affects people differently, even if they have the same condition.</p>
                            <cite>Natalie, Co-op Represent network.</cite>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>After the vision session, Represent decided to focus on breaking down the barriers to people talking about disability at work. They raise awareness through things like team huddles and being included in important discussions around diversity & inclusion at Co-op.</p>
                        <p>Represent want people to feel more confident about having conversations about disability.</p>
                        <blockquote class="coop-u-margin-t-48 coop-u-margin-b-48">
                            <p>Often people don’t bring it up because they’re afraid of using the wrong terms. But it’s better to have the conversation than not have the conversation at all.</p>

                        </blockquote>
                        <h3>What did the group learn from doing the workshop?</h3>
                        <p>The facilitator in the group is responsible for the pace and outcomes. They ask straight-forward questions to help everyone to understand the detail and help group information together.</p>
                        <blockquote class="coop-u-margin-t-48 coop-u-margin-b-48">
                            <p>We went from having lots of ‘noise’ around what we were doing to having specific things that we wanted to do. We wouldn’t have been able to do that without the structure of the vision and goals sessions.</p>
