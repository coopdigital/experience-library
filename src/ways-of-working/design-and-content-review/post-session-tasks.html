                        <p>Some people want to option to think about the design or content after the session, or they may miss the review meeting. If it fits within your timescale, let them know how to add comments and the deadline. You may get better responses if have a short turnaround, like the end of the day.</p>
                        <p>Review all of the comments and put the findings together with any other research. You could use a Miro board to visualise any patterns. As the designer or content designer itâ€™s up to you to make the decision on the next version or iteration of the design. You only need to change anything that everyone agreed on or there was evidence for making a change.</p>
                        <p>One way to do this is to find agreement on each point of feedback, but then take time to reflect on what change you want to make.</p>
                        <p>Produce and share the next version if relevant.</p>
