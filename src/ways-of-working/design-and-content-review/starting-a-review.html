                        <p>This is one way of doing this activity based on our experience. Itâ€™s designed for a facilitator to run this session, but anyone can use it to learn how the activity works.</p>
                        <p>You might want to adapt it or only use part of it.</p>
                        <p>Teams often find their own way of doing an activity. This is a guide to get you started.</p>

                        <h2>Welcome and introductions</h2>
                        <p>Welcome everyone to the session. Ask everyone to introduce themselves if they do not know each other.</p>
                        <p>Let everyone know that the session is about supporting and learning from each other. You can use the information in the guidance [link] section to talk about this.</p>
                        <p>Go through your running order and structure for your crit.</p>
