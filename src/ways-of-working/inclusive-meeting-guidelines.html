                        <p>The way we collaborate has changed.</p>
                        <p>With a lot of meetings now online, it can be harder for people to contribute effectively. This can mean some voices are not heard.</p>
                        <p>We've created these guidelines to help people collaborate effectively and inclusively. We want everyone to be able to contribute in a way they feel comfortable.</p>
                        <p>We think these guidelines will encourage more:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>voices to be heard</li>
                            <li>inclusive discussions</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>And as a result, Co-op will:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>become aware of problems earlier</li>
                            <li>save money, as problems can be fixed earlier</li>
                            <li>create more inclusive products and services</li>
                            <li>open up our products and services to more people</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2 class="coop-u-margin-t-64">1. Give everyone the opportunity to contribute</h2>
                        <p>Ask people if they want to contribute.</p>
                        <p>Allow people to contribute anonymously or in smaller groups.</p>
                        <p>Check if people can access the tools you're using, explain how to use them and offer an alternative if necessary.</p>
                        <p>Use visible timers and allow thinking time.</p>
                        <p>Use captions and transcripts where possible.</p>
                        <p>Consider how people could contribute outside of the meeting, in their own time.</p>

                        <h2 class="coop-u-margin-t-64">2. Set clear expectations, early</h2>
                        <p>Send out an agenda in advance.</p>
                        <p>Clearly state the purpose of the meeting and the outcome you want to achieve.</p>
                        <p>Give a running order, include approximate times.</p>
                        <img src="{{ '/images/decorative/IMG-2.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="coop-u-margin-t-32 coop-u-margin-b-64" alt="">
                        <h2 class="coop-u-margin-t-64">3. Give context: do not assume any prior knowledge</h2>
                        <p>Reiterate any information that someone would need to know to be able to contribute.</p>
                        <p>Give regular recaps. Consider taking notes as you go so you can easily refer back.</p>
                        <p>Be mindful of late joiners and the context they might lack.</p>
                        <img src="{{ '/images/decorative/IMG-3.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="coop-u-margin-t-32 coop-u-margin-b-64" alt="">
                        <h2 class="coop-u-margin-t-64">4. Use clear language</h2>
                        <p>Do not use acronyms without explaining what they mean.</p>
                        <p>Use plain English.</p>
                        <p>Be mindful of people who are new to the organisation or team. If you use jargon, explain what you mean.</p>
                        <img src="{{ '/images/decorative/IMG-4.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="coop-u-margin-t-32 coop-u-margin-b-64" alt="">
                        <h2 class="coop-u-margin-t-64">5. Respect people’s time </h2>
                        <p>Book only the amount of time you need with people, and allow people to leave if they've contributed all they need to.</p>
                        <p>Plan your meeting to allow people breaks between meetings, for example 5 or 15 minutes past the hour.</p>
                        <p>If the meeting is long, schedule in regular breaks.</p>

                        <h2 class="coop-u-margin-t-64">6. Value all contributions equally</h2>
                        <p>Give everyone a chance to speak, do not allow one voice to dominate. If you’re referencing what’s been inputted, reference contributions from a range of people.</p>
                        <p>Consider your audience. Be prepared to adapt your approach or process to encourage contribution from more people.</p>

                        <h2 class="coop-u-margin-t-64">7. Encourage clarity, curiosity, and challenges</h2>
                        <p>Explain how people can ask questions.</p>
                        <p>Encourage people to get clarity on things they do not understand.</p>
                        <p>Allow people to ask questions anonymously, for example by adding post-its to a collaboration board.</p>
