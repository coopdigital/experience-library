                        <p>The Co-op, like many businesses, is on a journey of digital transformation.</p>
                        <p>Former Director of Digital Services at Co-op, Tom Loosemore, defined digital in a a tweet that went viral in 2016 as:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p class="coop-t-h2">“Digital: Applying the culture, practices, processes & technologies of the Internet-era to respond to people’s raised expectations”</p>
                            <cite>Tom Loosemore</cite>
                        </blockquote>

                        <h2>Creating the right environment for change</h2>
                        <p>We spent time with colleagues from across the Co-op to understand their needs for embedding change at scale.</p>
                        <p>We captured data and insight from colleagues using surveys, one to one interviews and ethnographic research techniques. We also read articles and studies from across the industry, outside of the Co-op.</p>
                        <p>We found a number of themes for enabling change.</p>

                        <h3>Reassurance</h3>
                        <p>Colleagues and leaders talked about uncertainty at times of change.</p>
                        <p>People worry about how their role might change and how they can show value in a new environment.</p>
                        <p>Colleagues need support and reassurance.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>"Why try to do something on your own when there are people here to help you?​ Really what I want is support and commitment, not just information."​</p>
                            <cite>Research participant</cite>
                        </blockquote>
                        <img src="{{ '/images/decorative/reassurance.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="coop-u-margin-t-32 coop-u-margin-b-64" alt="">

                        <h3>Permission</h3>
                        <p>Colleagues can't always control how they manage their own workload.</p>
                        <p>People need to be able to focus on a project without being distracted by 'business as usual' work.</p>
                        <p>Colleagues need less hierarchical environments so that they can challenge leaders and ways of working and thinking.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>​"You need senior leaders to set the signals. You need to know that your boss has your back. Not checking every month ‘how are you doing against the plan’​. It’s exhausting justifying your existence."​</p>
                            <cite>Research participant</cite>
                        </blockquote>

                        <h3>Consistency</h3>
                        <p>Colleagues struggle to understand and talk about change when there are conflicting messages.</p>
                        <p>People use different terms to describe similar ways of working across Co-op.</p>
                        <p>Colleagues need consistency so that they can work together effectively.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>"The Co-op has too many competing priorities which doesn’t help with collaboration.​ You’re competing for budget.​ I want to spend time on my thing, not yours."​</p>
                            <cite>Research participant</cite>
                        </blockquote>
                        <img src="{{ '/images/decorative/consistency.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="coop-u-margin-t-32 coop-u-margin-b-64" alt="">

                        <h3>Transparency</h3>
                        <p>Colleagues don't know why change is happening and what is expected of them.</p>
                        <p>When leaders are transparent about what's happening, it helps people to commit to delivering business outcomes.</p>
                        <p>Colleagues need to feel safe to ask questions and say what they think.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>"We need to be comfortable that we’re allowed to tell the truth and not be perfect."</p>
                            <cite>Research participant</cite>
                        </blockquote>

                        <h3>Relevance</h3>
                        <p>Industry examples can be hard to translate into action at Co-op.</p>
                        <p>Seeing case study examples of how models work at Co-op gives people faith that it could work for them.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>"We were able to come away and look at what we do – try to shift that mindset which is incredibly difficult. Everything you’ve ever known and believe to be your bible suddenly didn’t apply anymore so it’s a challenge to change the way you think about it – you have to adapt and change."</p>

                        <h3>Time</h3>
                        <p>Colleagues and leaders do not have time to take a step back from delivery and think about what might not be working and what could change.</p>
                        <p>They need time to reflect and practice their new skills and techniques.​</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>"It's so important to learn together as a team. Having time to reflect and support each other makes our work better and me happier too."</p>
