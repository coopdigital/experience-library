                        <p>It’s important that everyone in the session feels comfortable and can contribute. If your group is new to collaborative sessions, you could review Co-op's <a href="/ways-of-working/inclusive-meeting-guidelines.html">inclusive meeting guidelines</a>.</p>
                        <p>If it’s relevant, you could also talk about:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>does everyone in the group have an equal voice in terms of the outcomes? You should be clear whether peoples’ opinions will be treated as guidance or influence the decision.</li>
                            <li>people having different opinions and being challenged is a good thing if it’s done in a respectful way. Diversity of thought will produce better outcomes.</li>
                            <li>is the chat function mainly for questions and comments? Using emojis and adding gifs might help people feel more connected but can also take attention away from the activity. Adding links to external sites that are off topic might be distracting.</li>
                        </ul>
