                        <p><strong>If you want to start a reflective practice on facilitating:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>make notes on how you think it went as soon as possible</li>
                            <li>ask people for feedback directly if you are comfortable doing that</li>
                            <li>watch the recording if there is one. Watching yourself back can be difficult but very useful</li>
                            <li>identify any areas you want to improve and how you want to do that. It could be by asking someone more experienced for a chat or reading about it</li>
                            <li>make notes about how you could improve your materials straight away, ideally on them. It's so easy to forget the detail.</li>
