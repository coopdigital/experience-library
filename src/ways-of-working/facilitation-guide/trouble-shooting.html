                        <p>One of the things that is most interesting and challenging about facilitating is, what to do when things go off topic or something unexpected happens.</p>
                        <p>Having some tips that you can access during your session might help you feel more confident even if you do not use them.</p>

                        <h2>Tips on ‘what you could say when’:</h2>

                        <h3>People are confused or when you do not know if people have understood, which is most of the time when you’re working remotely:</h3>
                        <blockquote>Is there anything I can make clearer for you?</blockquote>
                        <p>Always assume someone hasn’t understood.</p>
                        <p>Try to avoid saying: “Does that make sense?” and “Is that okay?”</p>
                        <p>It can make people think that you doubt whether it makes sense or is okay. They may also not want to say that they do not understand.</p>

                        <h3>If you don’t know what someone means:</h3>
                        <blockquote>“Can you tell me more about that..”</blockquote>

                        <h3>If someone has skipped ahead to a different activity:</h3>
                        <blockquote>“We’re looking at x activity now and will move onto y in a few minutes.”</blockquote>
                        <p>If you’re working remotely, you can also use the Miro tool to “bring everyone to me” if you feel like people are lost on the board. See <a href="/experience-library/ways-of-working/facilitation-guide/find-out-more-about-facilitating.html">resources</a>.</p>

                        <h3>If someone is talking too much:</h3>
                        <blockquote>“Does everyone agree with that or think something different?”</blockquote>
                        <blockquote>“What does everyone else think?”</blockquote>
                        <blockquote>“That’s an interesting point. Would anyone like to respond?”</blockquote>
                        <p><strong>if they're off point:</strong></p>
                        <blockquote>“Can we park that there...”</blockquote>
                        <p><strong>if they're on point:</strong></p>
                        <blockquote>“Would anyone like to respond?”</blockquote>

                        <p>Try to find a way to interject. Often this means waiting for a pause. This takes practice.</p>

                        <h3>If someone hasn’t talked at all?</h3>
                        <blockquote>“has anyone else got anything new or different to add?”</blockquote>
                        <blockquote>“In a few minutes we’re going to talk about x. I’ll ask two of you to say what they think.”</blockquote>
                        <blockquote>This helps people to prepare to say something.</blockquote>

                        <h3>If someone throws in a question or comment that takes you completely off topic because they have something they want to talk through:</h3>
                        <blockquote>“We’re starting to go down a different route and talk about a different topic. Do you want to explore that or do you want to carry on with what we were working today?”</blockquote>

                        <h3>If you start to go round in circles:</h3>
                        <blockquote>“I feel like we’ve exhausted this, shall we move on or has anyone got anything new or different add?”</blockquote>
                        <blockquote>“Has anyone got anything to add that will help the group move on?”</blockquote>
                        <p>This way if anyone adds anything it will add value and if not, you can move on.</p>
