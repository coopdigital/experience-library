                        <p>You can get inspiration and more detail for designing sessions in <a href="/experience-library/ways-of-working/facilitation-guide/find-out-more-about-facilitating.html">the resources section</a>.</p>
                        <p>Always include a <a href="/ways-of-working/activities/check-in.html">check-in</a> for people to say hello and talk to each other before the main activities. Creating an opportunity for people to share how they are feeling before the session will help you find out wants to contribute. If people speak at the start, it’s also more likely they will join in during the session.</p>
                        <p>When you’re designing activities, plan time for silent thinking or reading time if people need it.</p>
                        <p>Be specific and provide examples to support your point or show people what you want them to do.</p>
                        <p>Include a balance between presenting information, capturing ideas and generating discussion. A variety of activities will help your team concentrate.</p>
                        <p>Check-out activities invite everyone to share immediate feedback about whether the session achieved the outcomes. They also encourage people to reflect on activities and their own contributions.</p>
