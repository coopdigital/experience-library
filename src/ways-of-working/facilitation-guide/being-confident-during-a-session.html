                        <p>When you're facilitating a session try to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>be brave and go for it,   everyone wants the session to go well</li>
                            <li>start with your plan and expect the unexpected. Itâ€™s rare for everything to go exactly as you expect but that's ok</li>
                            <li>research your session content and audience well so that you can be confident and step in when you need to</li>
                            <li>find the balance between allowing discussion and moving the conversation on</li>
                            <li>trust your gut feelings and adapt the approach based on how your group responds</li>
                            <li>ask your group how they can best use the time if things start to go off-track</li>
