                        <p>Facilitating a session is a brilliant way to work through activities together with your team. You can save time and money by making sure everyone has the same understanding and agrees on what you should do next. But you might not always need a session.</p>
                        <p>Sessions are only a good use of time when:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>you have enough time to plan it well</li>
                            <li>you're willing to consider everyone’s opinion</li>
                            <li>you have everyone you need in the room</li>
                            <li>you have enough time for discussion during activities or are happy to get as far as you can and save some activities for later. Rushing risks bad decisions and people not feeling heard</li>
                            <li>you need everyone’s input to decide what to do next. If you already have a decision, you can let everyone know without a session</li>
                            <li>everyone can access the session remotely or in person, depending on how you run it</li>
                        </ul>
