                        <p>Do not use sensory directions.</p>
                        <p>For example, do not write 'use the information above to fill out the form below and then click the green submit button on the side'.</p>
                        <p>People who use some assistive technology may not be able to tell where the things you are referring to are on the page.</p>
                        <p>People with colour vision deficiency (CVD, also known as colour blindness) may not be able to tell which button you mean if you reference it by colour alone.</p>
