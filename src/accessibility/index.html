                        </blockquote>
                        <p>If we create products, services or communications that people cannot use or understand, we stop them choosing Co-op.</p>
                        <p>This can not only cause stress, anxiety and frustration for people, but it can alienate them.</p>
                        <p>Accessibility means removing these barriers, or not creating barriers in the first place.</p>
