    <p>At Co-op we want anyone to be able to use our products and services. We have committed to this in our <a href="https://www.coop.co.uk/accessibility" class="link-blue">accessibility policy</a></p>
    <p>This means we need to design, build and set things up in a way that is considerate of a range of needs. The guidance, tools and resources here will help you to do this. </p>
