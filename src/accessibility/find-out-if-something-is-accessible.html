                    <h2>Critical accessibility testing framework</h2>
                    <p>You can use the framework to test a common user journey or a new component.</p>
                    <p>The board provides instructions on how to do automated and manual tests to find the most critical accessibility issues. This can help you to find the barriers that could stop people using something, and what you need to do to remove them.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lMK6t0M=/?moveToWidget=3074457356619647171&cot=14">Go to the critical accessibility testing Miro board</a> (Co-op colleagues only).</p>
                    <h2>Accessibility review template</h2>
                    <p>The review template sets out how to assess a product or service for accessibility. It's based on a critical accessibility test and a series of tests with users of different assistive technology. Through testing and user research, find what the major barriers to using the service are, and which standards are not met.</p>
                    <p>To do an accessibility review:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_l9CbLdw=/?moveToWidget=3074457360614119468&cot=14">Go to the accessibility review template board</a> (Co-op colleagues only).</li>
                        <li>Make a copy for your review and rename it.</li>
                        <li>Follow the instructions.</li> 
                        <li>Record results and recommendations.</li>
                        <li>Create a plan to fix any issues found and remove barriers.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h2>PDFs</h2>
                    <p>PDFs are often not accessible. They make it hard for assistive technology users to follow and get the information from them.</p>

                    <p>Try to avoid using PDFs and use web pages instead wherever possible.</p>
