                    <h2>Policy guidelines</h2>
                    <p>Co-opâ€™s accessibility policy states that 1 in 5 research participants must be people with an access need.</p>
                    <p>By doing this we:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>make sure that everyone can access Co-op digital services including our website, communications and resources</li>
                        <li>consider digital accessibility at every stage of products and service development at Co-op</li>
                        <li>constantly review and improve everything we build and develop</li> 
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Fable</h2>
                    <p>Co-op works with Fable, a provider of user research and accessibility testing. Fable has a community of disabled people who use various types of assistive technology. You can arrange research interviews and other tests with people from this community within a few days of sending a request.</p>
                    <p>To get access to Fable, email accessibility@coop.co.uk</p>
                    <h2>Co-op accessibility panel</h2>
                    <p>The Digital Products and Design team are getting a panel of colleagues together to be involved in research who are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>living with a disability, condition or illness</li>
                        <li>consider English as their second language</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This is to help make sure that everyone can access Co-op services.</p>
                    <p>You can:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=tLdPg01i6E2pdy1GrZeb2fZVJQFDiVBPobzKS7JgRYpUQUtUM1RKQ1lHWkJNU1BSSFpQWFdGN0MyTSQlQCN0PWcu">apply to be part of panel</a>.</li> 
                        <li>speak to your user researcher to arrange research with members of the panel (currently digital product teams only)</li> 
                    </ul>
