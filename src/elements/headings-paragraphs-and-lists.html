                        <h3>Headings</h3>
                        <p>You should use headings and subheadings to break your content up. This makes your content:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>easier for people to read</li>
                            <li>more accessible for those using assistive technology like screen readers</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Headings should be short, clear and descriptive because this helps people to understand what content is there and find the content they need.</p>
                        <p>Front-load your headings where possible. Statements work better than questions and they let you put the keyword first.</p>
                        <p>Good example: £5 Freezer Fillers</p>
                        <p>Bad example: Looking to stock up on brands you love? Browse our £5 Freezer Filler</p>
                        <h3>Paragraphs</h3>
                        <p>Write paragraphs using short simple sentences. As a general rule, use 25 words or less. Longer lines can be difficult to read.</p>
                        <h3>Lists</h3>
                        <h4>Bullet lists</h4>
                        <p>Use bullet points to break up a list of items. It makes your content easier to read and understand.</p>
                        <p>Bullets must:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>use a lead-in line</li>
                            <li>make sense running on from the lead-in line</li>
                            <li>use lower case at the start of the bullet</li>
                            <li>have only one sentence per bullet point - use commas, dashes or semicolons to expand on an item</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Bullets should not:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>be paragraphs using the list format for visual effect</li>
                            <li>use a full stop after the last bullet point</li>
                            <li>include ‘or’ or an ‘and’ after the bullets</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Numbered lists</h4>
                        <p>Use a numbered list for a logical sequence of things, like a series of tasks that must be done in a certain order.</p>
                        <p>Unlike bullet lists, they do not need a lead-in line and should be complete sentences that start with a capital letter and end with a full stop.</p>

                        <p>Our headings, paragraphs and lists have set font sizes.</p>
                        <p><a href="/foundations/font-sizes.html">Go to the guidelines on font sizes</a>.</p>
                        <p>We’ve used our foundations to design headings, paragraphs and lists.</p>
                        <h3>Headings</h3>
                        <p>Headings should be structured logically. A:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Heading 1 (H1) is your main page heading (you should only have one of these)</li>
                            <li>Heading 2 (H2) is your subheading (you can have several of these)</li>
                            <li>Heading 3 (H3) is your subheading within a H2 section (you can have several of these)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You can adjust the size of headings to fit your design, for example you can make a H2 look smaller.</p>
                        <p>If you change the styling of the heading, keep the heading attributes in the code so your content still has a logical heading structure.</p>
                        <p>This is because assistive technology users can use the headings as a way to navigate around the page.</p>
                        <h3>Paragraphs</h3>
                        <p>Paragraphs and lead paragraphs are set at a size to make content readable.</p>
                        <p>Do not change the paragraph font sizes, or the line spacing. These have been set to meet our <a href="https://www.coop.co.uk/accessibility/standards#line-spacing"></a>accessibility standards.</p>
