                        <p>Our headings, paragraphs and lists have set font sizes.</p>

                        <p>We’ve used our foundations to design headings, paragraphs and lists.</p>
                        <h3>Headings</h3>
                        <p>Headings should be structured logically. This is because assistive technology users can use the headings as a way to navigate around the page.</p>
                        <p>Heading 1 (H1) is the main page heading, you should only have one of these.</p>
                        <p>Heading 2 (H2) is a subheading, you can have several of these.</p>
                        <p>Heading 3 (H3) is a subheading within a H2 section, you can have several of these.</p>
                        <p>You can use our custom font sizes to adjust the size of headings to fit your design. For more information, <a href="{{ '/foundations/font-sizes.html' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">go to the guidelines on font sizes</a>.</p>
                        <h3>Paragraphs and lists</h3>
                        <p>Paragraphs, lead paragraphs and lists are set at a size to make content readable.</p>
                        <p>Do not change the font sizes, or the line spacing. These have been set to meet our <a href="https://www.coop.co.uk/accessibility/standards#line-spacing">accessibility standards</a>.</p>
