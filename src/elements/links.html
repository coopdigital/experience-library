                        <p>If you add a link, consider the user's onward journey. Sometimes links can distract the user from their core task meaning they may not return.</p>
                        <p>Use links to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>help users get to where they need to go</li>
                            <li>avoid duplicating information that exists elsewhere </li>
                            <li>link to an authority on a subject</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Link text must:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>not use vague terms, for example 'click here' or 'more information'</li>
                            <li>describe the page it goes to, for example '<a href="https://www.coop.co.uk/accessibility/standards">Co-op digital accessibility standards</a>'</li>
                            <li>make sense when read out of context – screen readers can read link text in isolation without the surrounding content</li>
                            <li>reflect what the user will see when they get to the page</li>
                            <li>be at the end, not the middle of a sentence – this makes it easier for people to scan</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If the link is to an action:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>include the action at the start of the link, for example, ‘book an appointment’</li>
                            <li>make the text between 2 and 4 words where possible – this can make the action quicker to understand</li>
                            <li>consider using a button if the action is the main thing you want someone to do on a page</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Regularly review the links you use and remove or update any that are out-of-date or no longer work.</p>
                        <h3>Linking to other websites</h3>
                        <p>You might need, or want, to link to other websites that are not owned by Co-op (external websites). Any external websites you link to must be:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>high quality</li>
                            <li>relevant</li>
                            <li>trustworthy</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If they're not, it could damage Co-op's reputation.</p>
                        <p>If you're linking to an external site tell the user that they’re leaving our site, for example, ‘For more information visit <a href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/">citizensadvice.org.uk</a>'.</p>
                        <p>If it’s a short URL (web address) – that is it contains no symbols and has a maximum of one ‘/' – use a full URL, for example 'For more information, go to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport">bbc.co.uk/sport</a>’. This means that people could remember it, or write it down, if they wanted to visit the site later.</p>
                        <p>If it’s a complex URL – that is it contains symbols or more than one ‘/' – use words as the link text, for example, ‘See the <a href="https://readabilityguidelines.co.uk/content-design/links/">Content Design London Readability guidelines on links</a>’.</p>
                        <h3>Opening links</h3>
                        <p>Links should usually be set to open in the same tab, so that people can use the 'back' button to navigate.</p>
                        <p>If you think the link should open in a new tab, include ‘(opens in a new tab)' as part of the link. For example, you can set a link to open in a different tab so that someone does not lose their progress in a form.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="el-c-primary-section">

                        <p>Links should have the correct colour contrast. To see the colours we use for links, <a href="{{ '/foundations/colours.html' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">go to the guidelines on colours</a>.</p>
                        <h3>Underline</h3>
                        <p>In general, links should be underlined. The underline should disappear when the user hovers their cursor over it.</p>
                        <p>You do not need to underline a link if:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>there’s another visual cue that indicates that it’s a link, for example the arrow icon</li>
                            <li>it’s in context, for example within a header or footer</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Focus ring</h3>
                        <p>The focus ring appears as a purple outline around any object, including links, when someone selects it.</p>
                        <p>Do not remove the focus ring. Some people who use assistive technology need it to navigate our products and services.</p>
