                        <h2>Guidelines</h2>
                        <p>The logo should:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>be 38px in width and 40px in height</li>
                            <li>be an SVG (scalable vector graphic) so it shows up clearly on all devices</li>
                            <li>be in the top left corner of the webpage so it acts as a consistent signpost</li>
                            <li>only be used once per page (not including when it's used in images)</li>
                            <li>be ‘Co-op blue’ colour when used in the header</li>
                            <li>have invisible padding around it to creates a tappable area that’s large enough to meet our accessibility standards for touch target size</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Online, only use 'Co-op blue’:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>for the logo</li>
                            <li>within images</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This is because is not accessible for text.</p>
                        <p>You can sometimes use the Co-op logo in white on a ‘Co-op blue’ background, for example on app or homescreen icons.</p>
                        <p>You can use images containing the logo, for example product images.</p>
