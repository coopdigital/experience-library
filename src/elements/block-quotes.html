                        <h2>Guidelines</h2>
                        <p>You can use block quotes to make a quote stand out visually.</p>
                        <p>Co-op block quotes are made up of:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a grey line above and below</li>
                            <li>the text you’re quoting</li>
                            <li>who the quote is from</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You can choose from 2 block quote sizes: standard or large.</p>
                        <h3>The text you're quoting</h3>
                        <p>If you use a block quote:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>start the quote on a new line</li>
                            <li>do not include quotation marks</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>To find out how to use quotation marks if you’re not using a block quote, <a href="{{ '/content-guidelines/style-and-patterns/punctuation-and-formatting.html#anchor-quotes' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">go to the content guidelines on quotes</a>.</p>
                        <p class="coop-u-margin-t-32">Use quotes that help your user to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>understand the content better</li>

                        </ul>
                        <h3>Who the quote is from</h3>
                        <p>Reference who you got the quote from. This can include the person's name, job title, organisation and website, if relevant.</p>
                        <p>You could use quotes from:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>an expert</li>
